    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Jeremy Lee, the chef of London’s Quo Vadis and the author of Cooking:
      Simply and Well, for One or Many, saves his lobster feasting for when he’s
      at home on the Scottish coast, where he and his family have long plucked
      the local crustaceans from fishermen’s tanks at the pier in Cairn. Lee
      takes great care to pick every sweet morsel from the shells, and finds
      that this simple oven-roasted dish requires no accompaniment. Better by
      far to enjoy it with a plate of asparagus or oysters beforehand, or
      perhaps a salad.
